MySQL Schema
============

* This MySQL query extracts the database schema by querying the INFORMATION_SCHEMA database, which contains metadata about all other databases. The query retrieves the CREATE TABLE statement for each table in a specific database.

* It concatenates relevant information including the table name, columns, data types, default values, NULL property, and any extras like AUTO_INCREMENT. It also retrieves foreign key constraint information.

* Please note that the query simplifies the CREATE TABLE syntax and might not include some elements such as character set, collation, table comments, and indices (other than those related to foreign keys).
